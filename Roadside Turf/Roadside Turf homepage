## Map (geomap) transformations prepare time, join by labels

SELECT
  time,
  node_id,
  display_name,
  metric,
  value
FROM
(SELECT
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY node_id, measure ORDER BY time DESC) r,
  time,
  value,
  measure as "metric",
  node_id,
  display_name
FROM $project_key.data
WHERE
  measure IN ('Longitude', 'Latitude')
) x
WHERE x.r <= 1
ORDER BY x.time ASC

## Nodes

SELECT

WHERE
  node_id IN ($node)
Group by raw.display_name
  ORDER BY 1
